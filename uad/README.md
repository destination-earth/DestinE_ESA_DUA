# UAD COMPONENTS DESCRIPTIONS AND INTERACTIONS

The UAD Service provides a structured approach to assessing the impact of the DestinE initiative on academic and policy documents. By integrating Splunk Enterprise, OpenWebUI, and AI-driven querying, users can gain valuable insights into mission-related publications, track research trends, and evaluate policy influence efficiently.

By integrating advanced document retrieval mechanisms, machine learning classification, a powerful data analytics platform, and AI-assisted search capabilities, the UAD Service provides a robust framework for assessing and visualizing the influence of DestinE across scientific and policy discourse. This interconnected system ensures that users - from researchers and policymakers to decision-makers - can effectively analyse, interpret, and derive actionable insights from the wealth of academic and policy publications associated with the initiative.

## Components Overview

### Document Metadata Processing

DUA UAD Splunk module oversees collecting and displaying the statistics about the DestinE and various use-cases usage assessment. Several user interfaces are provided by the component, giving the user a wide range of filters to show documents information and statistics. Also, a powerful AI assistant is available, giving the user the possibility to ask specific questions about the initiatives documents collected by the system.

The UAD relies on metadata generated by the TIA module, which extracts and processes the following attributes from retrieved documents:

- Title
- Authors
- Publication journal
- Publication date
- Document type (academic, policy, ESA tech)
- Source repository
- Subject initiative
- Initiative mission
- Document abstract
- Thumbnail of the front page
- Classification label (standard, influential, benchmark)
- Classification confidence

Metadata is uploaded to Splunk Enterprise for analytics and visualization. The same metadata, including full document text, is also stored in an OpenWebUI-powered knowledge base for AI-assisted querying.


### Splunk Enterprise

Splunk Enterprise is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software platform for searching, monitoring, and analysing machine-generated big data via a web-style interface. It enables efficient data indexing, storage, and retrieval, making it a suitable choice for managing the extensive document metadata collected by the UAD Service. Splunk Enterpriseâ€™s HTTP Event Collector (HEC) is used to ingest metadata from the TIA module, allowing for seamless integration and efficient data processing. The indexed data is then leveraged in dashboards to provide insights and analytics for users.

### OpenWebUI and AI Assistant for Earth Observation

OpenWebUI is an open-source web-based interface designed to facilitate user interactions with large language models. It serves as the front-end for the AI Assistant for Earth Observation, providing an intuitive and responsive chat experience. The AI Assistant is powered by Ollama, a lightweight and efficient model server designed for running local AI models, and Mistral-7B, an advanced large language model developed within a European context. Mistral-7B is particularly noteworthy as it represents a significant step in Europe's efforts toward AI sovereignty, ensuring that high-performance, open-source models are available without reliance on non-European technological ecosystems. This model is optimized for natural language understanding and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG [RD-60]), making it ideal for answering mission-related inquiries with high accuracy and relevance.
