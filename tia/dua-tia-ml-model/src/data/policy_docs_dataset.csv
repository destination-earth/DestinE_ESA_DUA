It highlights the importance of climate monitoring and prediction services for climate-sensitive policy sectors, including health, transport, and energy. The document notes that Europe has the capacity to measure essential climate variables (ECVs) from space, but the current reliance on research funding limits activities to test cases and demonstrator projects. A stable financial platform is necessary to secure operational climate information services in Europe. The document also emphasizes the need for increased computing resources and a move away from the current dependence on research funding. It suggests that a dedicated study is urgently needed to identify the current levels of public expenditure on climate information provision. The document concludes that Europe has the scientific and technical skills to provide full access to standardized data for climate, but the lack of a stable financial platform is a fundamental block to reliably generating products for operational users.;0.0026118832060061;67.017365;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0.372297359428188;0.6826025419307159;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;benchmark;2.0

The EU's objective of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 has not been met, and the ecosystem services provided by Europe's seas and coasts are deteriorating. The document identifies various drivers of these impacts, including fishing and aquaculture, land-based activities, chemical pollution, and the exploitation of oil and gas resources. Climate change has increased ecosystem vulnerability, with sea surface temperature changes up to six times greater than in the global oceans. The document also discusses the European Union's policies governing the coastal and marine environment, including the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the Integrated Maritime Policy. These policies aim to promote sustainable use and conservation of marine resources, but the document notes that further action is needed to address the scale and complexity of the environmental challenges. The document concludes that a more integrated and coordinated approach is required to address the impacts on Europe's seas and coasts. The EU's policies and directives, such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the Water Framework Directive, aim to improve the quality of freshwater and reduce pollution before it enters coastal waters. However, the document notes that many of the activities that harm the environment are a consequence of immediate human needs, and that these impacts can have amplified and cascading effects within the ecosystem, potentially leading to ecosystem collapse.;0.0037037418082393;53.57889;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;5;0.2662130906080313;0.5734244312936289;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.4;0.5882352941176471;influential;1.0

The study aims to assess the current state of the European downstream space market and shed light on the potential use of services and products based on space data and information in both the public and private sector. The study found that the European downstream space market is highly fragmented, with a limited number of large players and many specialized micro, small and medium enterprises. The market is dominated by the US, with companies like Google handling, processing and distributing Earth Observation data to a large audience of users. The study identified several barriers to the development of the sector, including policy barriers, market constraints, governance difficulties, technical issues and lack of skills. The study recommends increasing the budget dedicated to space research, legislative actions to create an incentive for the use of space satellite data, and improving the data distribution system and governance framework. The study also highlights the potential for developing commercial services in precision agriculture, insurance services and oil and gas exploration activities.

Volcanic activity can release large quantities of sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere, posing a potential health hazard and impacting aircraft components. The aviation industry wants to better understand the frequency and level of potential exposure and what would be required to deliver a suitable forecast capability. The report outlines the capabilities required to provide an operational forecast for aviation of the presence and amount of volcanic sulphur dioxide. It makes recommendations on the components needed to deliver such a service and assesses their current operational readiness. The forecast process for volcanic sulphur dioxide is similar to that for forecasting quantitative volcanic ash, so many of the identified requirements and challenges are similar and not new. The report presents the current state of the art in modelling, satellite retrievals, and techniques for combining models and observations known as data fusion. It shows that a model capable of representing the chemistry and transport of the sulphur dioxide plume is needed, satellite observations are essential for detecting and constraining the sulphur dioxide release, and data fusion techniques add considerable value for refining the eruption source parameters and improving the forecast. The impact of applying different sulphur dioxide concentration thresholds on the requirement to produce sulphur dioxide forecasts for aviation has also been assessed. The lowest sulphur dioxide threshold evaluated is 0.175 ppm, which is the World Health Organization's short-term threshold for exposure to sulphur dioxide.

The average temperature in 2015 had already risen by more than one degree since the pre-industrial period, and many extreme weather and climate events recorded during 2011-2015 had their likelihood of occurring substantially enhanced by human-induced climate change. The report confirms that the period 2011-2015 was consistent with established long-term warming trends due to rising levels of greenhouse gases. The single most significant event of the period in humanitarian terms was the 2011-2012 famine in the Horn of Africa, which was attributed to drought. Many extreme events in the period 2011-2015, especially those involving extreme high temperatures, have had their probabilities substantially increased as a result of anthropogenic climate change. The report also notes that the unusually prolonged, intense and hot dry seasons in the Amazon basin of Brazil in both 2014 and 2015 are of considerable concern in the context of potential tipping points in the climate system. The assessment describes the state of the key components of the climate system in the period 2011-2015, focusing on events such as multi-year droughts that require a longer-term perspective than is possible in an annual report.

The European Commission's Copernicus programme is a world leader in providing EO space data and information to user communities worldwide. The programme currently has eight operational satellites, known as the Sentinels, which measure and acquire large amounts of data over most of the polar areas. However, the programme remains partially reliant on third-party satellite missions to complement the Sentinels. The Copernicus Polar Expert Group's work has made an important contribution to the Copernicus programme, ensuring that the requirements of the user communities in the Arctic are understood and laying the groundwork for defining an operational Copernicus Polar Observing System. The report aims to provide evidence-based scientific support to the European policymaking process and highlights the geopolitical dimension of the Arctic and the need for an integrated European Union Policy for the Polar regions. The report also discusses the evolution of the Copernicus Space Component and plans for new satellite missions, including the Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) mission, the Copernicus Polar Ice and Snow Topography Altimeter (CRISTAL) mission, and the Radar Observing System for Europe at L-band (ROSE-L) mission. The report concludes that there is no single mission that can fulfill all the Polar Expert Group's observation requirements, but the strengths of the Polar High Priority Candidate Missions are their uniqueness and complementarity to one another and with the existing Sentinels.;0.0285950920736321;86.82393;0;0;1;0;0;0;1;0;1.0;0.9292272139816232;0.0;0.0;0.5;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.4;0.0;benchmark;2.0

It explains that surface-based observations include reports from meteorological stations, aircraft reports, and radiosonde ascents, while satellite-based observations use active and passive sensors from over 25 satellites. The document highlights the need to regularly measure the relative impact of each type of observing system on NWP forecasts and describes a data denial experiment (DDE) as a method to do this. The DDE involves running a full NWP experiment with a specific observation type withdrawn from the pre-processing and data assimilation steps. The results of the DDE are compared to a control run to determine the impact of the removed observation type on forecast quality. The document presents the results of several DDEs, including the Microwave Sounder & Imager DDE, which shows significant degradation in forecast quality when the observation type is removed. The categories with the largest detriment in forecast quality when withdrawn are those that include sounding information on temperature and humidity.

Global climate observations were instrumental for the IPCC to declare that climate change is 'unequivocal' with a 'clear' human influence. The Paris Agreement requires systematic observations to monitor its achievement and the impacts of mitigation measures. Climate observations support a wide range of users beyond the scientific community, including climate services, and are essential for emergency warning systems. The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) was established to coordinate global climate observations and facilitate their development and improvement. GCOS identifies and updates Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) that provide necessary information to understand, model, and predict climate. The system of systems observing architecture approach promotes a tiered approach to network design and implementation, including reference networks and baseline networks. GCOS works through three panels: the Atmospheric Observing Panel for Climate, the Ocean Observations Physics and Climate Panel, and the Terrestrial Observing Panel for Climate.

NASA is the lead agency tasked with detecting and monitoring celestial projectiles that could impact Earth. The agency has identified many of the largest near-Earth objects, but more work is needed. Congress has directed NASA to conduct a survey of all near-Earth objects greater than 140 meters in diameter. The committee's NASA authorization bill also supports efforts to study the physics of the Sun and its effects on Earth's magnetic field. NASA missions such as the Parker Solar Probe contribute to our understanding of solar phenomena behind space weather. NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center in Colorado complements NASA's work. High-energy space weather events can significantly disrupt air travel, radio communications, and electronic devices. The committee would benefit from the witnesses' testimony on how the United States is preparing for these events. The United States has an indispensable role in addressing the challenges of planetary defense, space weather protection, and space situational awareness. The country is the world's preeminent spacefaring nation, and it is essential to construct a policy framework to meet these challenges. The space economy is crucial for the country's growth, and it is essential to manage space in a way that allows the economy to continue to grow. Threats like orbital debris, a congested space environment, space and weather, and near-Earth asteroids all pose a threat to the satellites. The committee has included a provision in the NASA Authorization Act requesting that the administration study new funding mechanisms to address missions of national importance.;0.0040455007597137;39.392887;0;0;1;0;0;0;4;0;0.5766449460461179;0.4012345874862352;0.0;0.0;0.3333333333333333;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.5333333333333333;0.0;influential;1.0

The workshop was hosted by the European Space Agency in Frascati, Italy, and was organized by the World Climate Research Programme and the Global Climate Observing System. The workshop aimed to promote intercomparison and evaluation of datasets of Essential Climate Variables following the use of Guidelines for the Generation of products meeting the GCOS Requirements. The workshop evaluated eight satellite-related essential climate variables, including cloud properties, surface radiation, sea ice, sea-surface temperature, surface winds, soil moisture, fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, and snow cover. The evaluation of these datasets highlighted the need for special attention to observing strategies, reprocessing of Fundamental Climate Data Records, atmospheric adjustment for satellite retrievals, independent expert-group assessment of datasets, indices of maturity and uncertainty, interdependence of variables, and long-term homogeneity of datasets. The global observing system for climate was also discussed, and it was noted that satellites cannot measure all the variables of interest and often lack long-term stability and homogeneity. The in situ networks are vital for the measurement of variables that cannot be measured from satellites, and reference sites provide detailed point measurements of several variables in specific climatic zones. The document concludes that a consistent framework for the evaluation of global climate datasets is needed, and that the establishment and maintenance of an inventory of global ECV datasets will provide a consistent and accessible source of information on global climate datasets.;0.0023683652884544;62.44346;0;0;0;0;0;0;2;0;0.122520121379595;0.5736811900496498;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.25;0.0;influential;1.0
